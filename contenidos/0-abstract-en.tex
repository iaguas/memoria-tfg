\begin{abstract}

Many techniques used for solving specific problems in computer science depend strongly on functions employed for processing the information and determinating of the best parameters for the problem-solving techniques. In particular, it usually happens with processing images (segmentation) tasks, which are applied through fuzzy techniques in the use of functions and variables for the problem. Precisely, this project fosters the utilization of DombiÂ´s funtions in substitution of REF functions, in the field of black and white images so as to find the best path to segment through the use of tresholding of a group of images and to reuse generally this method. Finally, the use of penalty functions allows us to get the most accurate threshold. OWA functions for the construction of fuzzy sets are also studied.
